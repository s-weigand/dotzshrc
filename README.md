# zshrc
My zsh config working with putty and windows

## Installation 

### Linux

`git clone https://github.com/s-weigand/zshrc.git && sudo bash zshrc/install.sh`

open new shell and all should be done :)

### Windows (putty)

execute `putty_zsh_reg.reg` to set colors for putty

install the Font `SourceCodePro` (taken from this awesome project https://github.com/powerline/fonts)

in putty you might need to change the font again (`Change Settings...->Category->Window->Appearance->Change...`)

and save it in `Default Settings` (`Change Settings...->Category->Session`)
